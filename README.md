Yet another **scroll'n'fling'n'zoom** view that supports both one and two finger
z00m feature (double click starts in/out z00m animation).

It supports any [Drawable][], so you can show any standard android [Drawable][]
(returned by [getDrawable][]) or [BitmapDrawable][] in order to show any [Bitmap][] or
even your custom [Drawable][].

Thank you.
